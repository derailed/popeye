# Popeye - A Kubernetes Cluster Sanitizer

Popeye is a utility that scans live Kubernetes cluster and reports potential issues with deployed resources and configurations. It sanitizes your cluster based on what's deployed and not what's sitting on disk. By scanning your cluster, it detects misconfigurations and ensure best practices are in place thus preventing potential future headaches. It aims at reducing the cognitive *over*load one faces when operating a Kubernetes cluster in the wild. Furthermore, if your cluster employs a metric-server, it reports potential resources over/under allocations and attempts to warn you should your cluster run out of capacity.

Popeye is a readonly tool, it does not alter any of your Kubernetes resources in any way!

## Installation

Popeye is available on Linux, OSX and Windows platforms.

* Binaries for Linux, Windows and Mac are available as tarballs in
  the [release](https://github.com/derailed/popeye/releases) page or
  via the SnapCraft link above.

* For OSX/Unit using Homebrew/LinuxBrew

   ```shell
   brew install derailed/popeye/popeye
   ```

* Building from source
   Popeye was built using go 1.12+. In order to build Popeye from source you must:
   1. Clone the repo
   2. Add the following command in your go.mod file

      ```text
      replace (
        github.com/derailed/popeye => MY_POPEYE_CLONED_GIT_REPO
      )
      ```

   3. Build and run the executable

        ```shell
        go run main.go
        ```

   Quick recipe for the impatient:

   ```shell
   # Clone outside of GOPATH
   git clone https://github.com/derailed/popeye
   cd popeye
   # Build and install
   go install
   # Run
   popeye
   ```

## Sanitizers

Popeye scans your cluster for best practices and potential issues.
Currently, Popeye only looks at nodes, namespaces, pods and services.
More will come soon! We are hoping Kubernetes friends will pitch'in
to make Popeye even better.

The aim of the sanitizers is to pick up on misconfigurations ie things
like ports mismatch, dead or unused resources, metrics utilization,
probes, container images, RBAC rules, naked resources, etc...

Popeye is not another static analysis tool. It runs and inspect Kubernetes resources on
live clusters and sanitize resources as they are in the wild!

Here is a list of some of the available sanitizers

### Save the report

To save the Popeye report to a file pass the `--save` flag to the command.
By default it will create a temp directory and will store the report there,
the path of the temp directory will be printed out on STDOUT.
If you have the need of specify the output directory for the report by your own
you can use the environment variable `POPEYE_REPORT_DIR`.

Example to save report in working directory:

```shell
  $ POPEYE_REPORT_DIR=$(pwd) popeye --save
```

## The Command Line

You can use Popeye standalone or using a spinach yaml config to
tune the sanitizer. Details about the Popeye configuration file are below.

```shell
# Dump version info
popeye version
# Popeye a cluster using your current kubeconfig environment.
popeye
# Popeye uses a spinach config file of course! aka spinachyaml!
popeye -f spinach.yml
# Popeye a cluster using a kubeconfig context.
popeye --context olive
# Stuck?
popeye help
```

## Output Formats

Popeye can generate sanitizer reports in a variety of formats. You can use the -o cli option and pick your poison from there.


| Format     | Description                                  | Default | Credits                                      |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| standard   | The full monty output iconized and colorized | yes     |                                              |
| jurassic   | No icons or color like it's 1989             |         |                                              |
| yaml       | As YAML                                      |         |                                              |

## The SpinachYAML Configuration

A spinach.yml configuration file can be specified via the `-f` option to further configure the sanitizers. This file may
container utilization threshold and specific sanitizer configurations as well as which resources to exclude in your cluster.

NOTE: This file will change as Popeye matures!

 A resource is identified by a resource kind and a fully qualified resource name ie `namespace/resource_name`. For example a pod named fred-1234 in namespace blee FQN will be `blee/fred-1234`. This provides for differentiating `fred/p1` and `blee/p1`. For cluster wide resources, `FQN=name`. Exclude rules can have either a straight string match or a regular expression. In the later case the regular expression must be indicated using the `rx:` prefix.

NOTE! Please thread carefully here with your regex as more resources than expected may get excluded from the report via a *loose* regex rule. When your cluster resources change, this could lead to rendering sanitization sub-optimal. Once in a while it might be a good idea to run Popeye `Config less` to make sure you are trapping any new issues that may have arised in your clusters...

Here is an example spinach file as it stands in this release. There is a fuller eks based spinach file in this repo under `spinach`. (BTW: for new comers into the project, might be a great way to contribute by adding cluster specific spinach file PRs...)

```yaml
# A Popeye sample configuration file
popeye:
  # Checks resources against reported metrics usage.
  # If over/under these thresholds a sanitization warning will be issued.
  # Your cluster must run a metrics-server for these to take place!
  allocations:
    cpu:
      underPercUtilization: 200 # Checks if cpu is under allocated by more than 200% at current load.
      overPercUtilization: 50   # Checks if cpu is over allocated by more than 50% at current load.
    memory:
      underPercUtilization: 200 # Checks if mem is under allocated by more than 200% at current load.
      overPercUtilization: 50   # Checks if mem is over allocated by more than 50% usage at current load.

  # Excludes excludes certain resources from Popeye scans
  excludes:
    # ConfigMap sanitizer exclusions...
    configmap:
      # Excludes key must match the singular form of the resource.
      # For instance this rule will exclude all configmaps named fred.v2.3 and fred.v2.4
      - name: rx:fred.+\.v\d+
    # Namespace sanitizer exclusions...
    namespace:
      # Exclude all fred* namespaces if the namespaces are not found (404), other error codes will be reported!
      - name: rx:kube
        codes:
          - 404
      # Exclude all istio* namespaces from being scanned.

## Popeye In Your Clusters!

Alternatively, Popeye is containerized and can be run directly in your Kubernetes clusters as a single shot or cronjob.

Here is a sample setup, please modify per your needs/wants. The manifests for this are in the k8s
directory in this repo.

```shell
kubectl apply -f k8s/popeye/ns.yml && kubectl apply -f k8s/popeye
```

```yaml
---
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name:      popeye
  namespace: popeye
spec:
  schedule: "* */1 * * *" # Fireoff Popeye once an hour
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          serviceAccountName: popeye
          restartPolicy: Never
          containers:
            - name: popeye
              image: quay.io/derailed/popeye:v0.3.6
              imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
              args:
                - -o
                - yaml
              resources:
                limits:
                  cpu:    500m
                  memory: 100Mi
```

## Popeye has got your RBAC!

In order for Popeye to do his work, the signed-in user must have enough RBAC oomph to
get/list the resources mentioned above.

Sample Popeye RBAC Rules (Subject to change!!)

```yaml
---
# Popeye ServiceAccount.
apiVersion: v1
kind:       ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name:      popeye
  namespace: popeye

# Popeye needs get/list access on the following Kubernetes resources.
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind:       ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: popeye
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources:
   - configmaps
   - deployments
   - endpoints
   - horizontalpodautoscalers
   - namespaces
   - nodes
   - persistentvolumes
   - persistentvolumeclaims
   - pods
   - secrets
   - serviceaccounts
   - services
   - statefulsets
  verbs:     ["get", "list"]
- apiGroups: ["rbac.authorization.k8s.io"]
  resources:
  - clusterroles
  - clusterrolebindings
  - roles
  - rolebindings
  verbs:     ["get", "list"]
- apiGroups: ["metrics.k8s.io"]
  resources:
  - pods
  - nodes
  verbs:     ["get", "list"]

---
# Binds Popeye to this ClusterRole.
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind:       ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: popeye
subjects:
- kind:     ServiceAccount
  name:     popeye
  namespace: popeye
roleRef:
  kind:     ClusterRole
  name:     popeye
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

## Report Morphology

The sanitizer report outputs each resource group scanned and their potential issues.
The report is color/emoji coded in term of Sanitizer severity levels:

| Level | Icon | Jurassic | Color     | Description     |
|-------|------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Ok    | âœ…    | OK       | Green     | Happy!          |
| Info  | ðŸ”Š   | I        | BlueGreen | FYI             |
| Warn  | ðŸ˜±   | W        | Yellow    | Potential Issue |
| Error | ðŸ’¥   | E        | Red       | Action required |

The heading section for each Kubenertes resource scanned,  provides an issue rollup summary count
for each of the categories above.

The Summary section provides a **Popeye Score** based on the sanitization pass on the given cluster.

## Known Issues

This initial drop is brittle. Popeye will most likely blow up...

* You're running older versions of Kubernetes. Popeye works best Kubernetes 1.13+.
* You don't have enough RBAC fu to manage your cluster (see RBAC section)

## Disclaimer

This is work in progress! If there is enough interest in the Kubernetes
community, we will enhance per your recommendations/contributions. Also if you
dig this effort, please let us know that too!

## ATTA Girls/Boys!

Popeye sits on top of many of open source projects and libraries. Our *sincere*
appreciations to all the OSS contributors that work nights and weekends
to make this project a reality!
